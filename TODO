make it so you can hold a key and click to make more worms / clicking during generation adds more worms?

settings UI moves

Fit canvas on screen size change

fix log sliders

clicking on color generate with that color

make next threads appear after different times

highlight cells for hex code




maybe touch up behavior for random cells that land on filled cells

X space : opens settings
_ esc : pause render
_ click while render : add new worm
_ shift click while render : start over
